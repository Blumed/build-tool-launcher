# build-tool-launcher
The tool is built for bitbucket but you can easily change it to github it you would like. For privacy reasons I have removed my information from the files. So you will need to update the three variables. Here are the steps to get this script to work.

1. Download or clone repo
2. `npm install` - *I used node 5.3.0 and I suggest you do the same*
3. Open up your editor and update these three values with your own 
  1. YOUR-URL
  2. USERNAME
  3. ifyoutypethisinitwilllaunchyournodemodule
4. test code by running `node index.js`
5. move your code into your global node packages `npm install -g`

Thats it! Now you can type in your launchers name and boom build tools and projects for days. 
Let me know if you have any questions or if you need a hand with anything. I am happy to help
